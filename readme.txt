# Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to predict the price of a car based on various features using machine learning techniques. The model analyzes historical car price data and helps users estimate the price of a car based on input parameters.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding price distribution, feature correlations, and outlier detection.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating meaningful features to improve model performance.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implementing regression models for price prediction.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Using metrics like R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Google colab
- Pandas, NumPy (for data handling)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)
- Scikit-learn (for machine learning models)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/riya-maurya/your-repo.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd your-repo
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook Car_Price_Prediction.ipynb
   ```
2. Run the cells sequentially to preprocess and analyze the car price data.

## Dataset
- The project uses a dataset containing historical car price details.
- Ensure the dataset is placed in the correct directory before running the notebook.

## Results
- The model provides estimated car prices based on input features.
- Visualizations highlight key factors affecting car prices.
- Evaluation metrics indicate the model's accuracy.

## Future Improvements
- Implement deep learning models for enhanced predictions.
- Optimize hyperparameters for better accuracy.
- Expand dataset to include more real-world data.
